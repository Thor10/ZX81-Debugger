# A ZX81 Debugger for Visual Studio Code

![ZX81](assets/ZX81.png)

This project provides a Visual Studio Extension in order to develop programs written in Z80 assembly language for the Sinclair ZX81. In particular:

* You can assemble Z80 programs without any other external software.
* You can debug your programs without Visual Studio Code, stepping, putting breakpoints, etc.
* Your program runs in an internal simulator and the debugger displays a simulated display and accepts inputs from the keyboard.
* If you prefer, you can use an external (and more accurate) simulator such as Zesarux.
