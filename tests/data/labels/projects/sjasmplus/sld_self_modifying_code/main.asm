; File to tests address file association when executing self modifyfing code.
; In SLD files there is only the address of the start of an instruction.
; If the instruction is modified by the program also addresses "inside"
; the original instruction may occur.
; If such an new instruction is executed ZX81 Debugger would create adisassembly file.
; The behavior is a little inconsistent as the first address still
; navigates to the original file although the instruction is "wrong".
;
; to at least get a consisten behavior ZX81 Debugger tries to estimate the size of an
; instruction and assiciates all addresses to this file.
